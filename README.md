Task Manager Application
This is a simple Task Manager application built using Node.js, Express, and EJS. 
The app allows users to manage three types of data: tasks, users, and projects. 
It provides a fully RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, along with dynamic EJS templates for a user-friendly interface. 
The project also includes a static HTML front-end for interacting with the API. The application uses middleware for request logging, method overriding, and error handling, with stylish and responsive CSS for a modern design. 
Perfect for learning and demonstrating RESTful API implementation with Express!
